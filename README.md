# Graphs
A graph is a collection of vertices and edges. We model the abstraction as a combination of three data types: Vertex, Edge, and Graph. A Vertex is a lightweight
object that stores an arbitrary element provided by the user (e.g., an airport code);
we assume it supports a method, element( ), to retrieve the stored element. An
Edge also stores an associated object (e.g., a flight number, travel distance, cost),
retrieved with the element( ) method.
